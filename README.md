# Angular 2 Starter Basic

A simple, yet comprehensive kit. Not trying to overcomplicate things, just get up and running with Angular 2.

All the essentials. None of the extras. Takes a lot of cues from the Angular [quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html).

> This is a great starter for getting straight to the Angular 2 and not dealing with any of the setup.
